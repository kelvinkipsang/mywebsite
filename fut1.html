<h1>
EURO 2016
</h1>
<h2>
<i>Can Spain make it a record three-in-a-row Euro titles?</i>
</h2>
<P>

The only ever back-to-back winners after disposing of Germany at Euro2008 and obliterating Italy at Euro2012, La Roja will be looking to<br/> bounce back from a pitiful performance at the 2014 World Cup.<br/>

Their first-round exit shocked many, and the presumed knock-on effect was that the ageing side had relinquished its stranglehold on world<br/> football.

Unfortunately for their rivals, the squad still possesses the majority of the players that made the Spain side of the early decade arguably<br/> the greatest of all-time.<br/>

There have been some questions over Spain's potency up front. Big names like Diego Costa, Fernando Torres and leading goal scorer in<br/> qualifying, Paco Alcacer, were all left out of the squad by manager Vicente Del Bosque.<br/>

What is clear is that Spain does not rely upon a hit man to push them through tournaments. In their 2008 triumph, David Villa led the team<br/> with four goals, and in 2012, Torres top scored with just three.<br/>

Spain's past triumphs have eventuated through the implementation and execution of a style of football that was subsequently copied<br/> throughout<br/> the world.

Will the champions of ball retention, off-the-ball movement and creativity triumph again at Euro2016?...

â€¦We think they will surely go close.
