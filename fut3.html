<i>Man Utd, Real Madrid target Monchi: I want to leave Sevilla</i>
</h2>
<P>

Sevilla chief Monchi has declared he wants to leave this summer.<br/>

Monchi has been linked with Manchester United and Real Madrid.<br/>

“For about a month, I noticed that something wasn't right in my head," he told SFC Radio.<br/>

“The pain of losing against Espanyol or Athletic [Bilbao] was greater than the happiness of winning in Basel [the EL final].<br/>

“I figured it was time to stop and make a change. I'd already told my colleagues that I'd have gone if we won a trophy.
<br/>
“My doubts then returned, but late on Sunday I made the decision [to leave].<br/>

“Still, what I can say is that I won't pay my release clause. I won't leave Sevilla through the backdoor."<br/>
